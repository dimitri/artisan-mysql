# Native MySQL driver for Common Lisp

See [](http://www.obrezan.com/lisp/mysql/), which is a LispWorks only very
simple implementation of a native MySQL driver for Common Lisp.

This code here by [Dimitri Fontaine](http://tapoueh.org/) is an attempt at
making the solution portable to other CL systems, and Quicklisp.
